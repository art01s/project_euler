Project Euler, is a website containing at this point 677 problems.
These problems are based on mathematical theory and require the user
to use their imagination to solve the problems.

The problems range extremely in difficulty, but are progressive in that way.
This means the first one is fairly straight forward and they get harder as you go
on.

These problems are not only very good practice for learning more mathematics and
programing but have great forum sections for each question where people have discussed
and posted their solutions.

This website will increase you understanding of computing and will make you think
critically about how your answer to the problem could have been more efficient and
other ways you could have tackled it.

These problems are hard, but they are really fun.
